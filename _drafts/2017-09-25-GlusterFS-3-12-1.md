We're in the process of shifting from using our [custom 'glue'][1] for orchestrating Docker deployments to Kubernetes.



## Implementation

## Automation / Puppet

## Performance

## Recovery


## Notes

[1] When we first deployed Docker to replace LXC and our legacy Puppet-heavy application configuration and deployment systems there really wasn't any existing tool to manage this, thus we rolled our own, mainly a few Ruby scripts combined with a Puppet / Hiera / Mcollective driven workflow.
