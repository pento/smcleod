As stated in [my announcement post](https://smcleod.net/tech/2019/06/29/leaving-infoxchange.html) - after 7~ years, I resigned from Infoxchange several months ago.

I planned on taking a holiday, relaxing, decompressing, dipping my toes in some off-the-shelf tech I haven't spent a lot of time with and performing some personal growth through reading a number of books that have been sitting on my 'too read' shelf.

This is exactly what I've done.

# I'm now open to new opportunities

## Considerations

- What _value_ will I bring to the organisation?
- What _gaps_ or _new ventures_ is the organisation looking to hire for?
- What might I _learn_ while working?
- What is the _team structure_ I'd be joining (if any)?
- What _technologies_ will I likely be working with?
- What _tooling_ will I be required to use?
- Will I have _fun_ (at least some of the time)?
- Will I have a reasonable amount of _creative freedom_ in my work?
- How much _bureaucracy_ will surround the role I'm in?


## My Resume / CV

These days I'm generally using [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sammcj/) as a living Resume / CV.

[My LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sammcj/) is also the best place to contact me regarding potential positions.


## A message to recruiters

If you have a potential role for me, I've come up with a basic list of things I'd like to know before having a formal chat.

As soon as I changed my status to 'Open to new job opportunities.' I've been swamped with messages on LinkedIn and email.

It would be greatly helpful (for both of us) you please send through some information about the position including:

- Role(s) and Responsibilities.
- Team size.
- _Internal_ team and company values.
- Example of what a day / week or month might look like in the position (might be hard I know).
- Must have experience.
- Highly desired experience.
- Nice to have experience.
- Salary range.
- Office location and parking (e.g. CBD - no parking but close to major train station, Inner-suburb - Company car parking, Outer-suburb - on street parking).

If you can't answer some of those, no problem - I'm just working on this as an initial template to get a handle on the offers coming through.

## What I've been upto (since Infoxchange)

- Took a 10 day holiday in Fiji, lying on the beaches, reading, decompressing and enjoying the sunshine and chatting with the locals.
- A lot of reading and research (Pitch Anything, Getting to Yes, Astrophysics for People in a Hurry, The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe, The Code of the Extraordinary Mind).
- Skimmed through several AWS Practitioner and Best Practise Architecture guides. (As mentioned, I've always designed and run cloud platforms - but not made heavy use other 'off the shelf' options.
- Completed the Amazon AWS Practitioner Essentials training.
- Caught up with fellow platform, automation engineers as well as people I see as mentors.
- Visited a few meetups.
