As stated in [my announcement post](https://smcleod.net/tech/2019/06/29/leaving-infoxchange.html) - after 7~ years, I resigned from Infoxchange several months ago.

I planned on taking a holiday, relaxing, decompressing, dipping my toes in some off-the-shelf tech I haven't spent a lot of time with and performing some personal growth through reading a number of books that have been sitting on my 'too read' shelf.

This is exactly what I've done.

# I'm now open to new opportunities

## Considerations

- What _value_ will I bring to the organisation?
- What _gaps_ or _new ventures_ is the organisation looking to hire for?
- What might I _learn_ while working?
- What is the _team structure_ I'd be joining (if any)?
- What _technologies_ will I likely be working with?
- What _tooling_ will I be required to use?
- Will I have _fun_ (at least some of the time)?
- Will I have a reasonable amount of _creative freedom_ in my work?
- How much _bureaucracy_ will surround the role I'm in?


## My Resume / CV

These days I'm generally using [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sammcj/) as a living Resume / CV.

[My LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sammcj/) is also the best place to contact me regarding potential positions.

## What I've been upto (since Infoxchange)

- Took a 10 day holiday in Fiji, lying on the beaches, reading, decompressing and enjoying the sunshine and chatting with the locals.
- A lot of reading and research (Pitch Anything, Getting to Yes, Astrophysics for People in a Hurry, The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe, The Code of the Extraordinary Mind).
- Skimmed through several AWS Practitioner and Best Practise Architecture guides. (As mentioned, I've always designed and run cloud platforms - but not made heavy use other 'off the shelf' options.
- Completed the Amazon AWS Practitioner Essentials training.
- Caught up with fellow platform, automation engineers as well as people I see as mentors.
- Visited a few meetups.
