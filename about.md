I try to keep my blog as lightweight and fast as possible by not using external resources (JS, CSS, Fonts, Analytics etc...), minimal JavaScript and by using a CDN (Cloudflare).

Likewise, I don't want to track you, so I avoid loading external fonts and libraries, the only analytic / usage data (mostly hit rate and unique visitors) I have are the information from Cloudflare acting as a CDN.
